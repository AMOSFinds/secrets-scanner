#  Secrets Scanner

Fast, open-source tool to detect API keys, credentials, and other secrets inside GitHub repositories — before they cause damage.

---

##  Overview

**Secrets Scanner** is a lightweight, self-hostable solution for finding leaked secrets in your codebase.  
Unlike heavy enterprise tools, it runs instantly, stores nothing, and can be deployed anywhere — including your own Render instance.

Built for developers, security engineers, and DevOps teams who want **visibility without complexity.**

---

##  Features

-  Scan any **public or private GitHub repository**
-  Detect API keys, tokens, passwords, and high-entropy strings
-  Asynchronous scanning for speed and scale
-  Optional **Slack alerts** for new leaks
-  No data storage — all scans run in memory
-  Easily deployable via Docker or Render
-  GitHub OAuth login for private repo access

---

##  Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/secrets-scanner.git
cd secrets-scanner

2. Create .env

Create a .env file in the project root using the example below:

API_KEY=choose-any-random-secret-key
SESSION_SECRET=another-secret-key
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-oauth-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-oauth-secret
GITHUB_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL=https://yourdomain.com/auth/github/callback
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your-slack-webhook-url
GITHUB_PAT=your-personal-access-token
Tip: Rename .env.example to .env and fill in your values.
Make sure .env is in your .gitignore file — never commit it.

3. Run with Docker
docker build -t secrets-scanner .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env secrets-scanner

4. Open your browser

Visit:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/ui

Or your deployed URL (e.g. Render, Railway, etc.)

Self-Hosting (Render Example)

Connect this repo to Render

Choose New Web Service → Environment: Docker

Add your environment variables under Environment Variables

Click Deploy

Your app will be live within minutes

 Architecture

Backend: FastAPI (Python)

Frontend: Jinja2 templates

HTTP Client: httpx for async GitHub API requests

Alerts: Slack Webhook integration

Containerization: Docker for portability

 Privacy & Security

Secrets Scanner follows a privacy-first philosophy:

No logs or code content are stored.

GitHub tokens are used only for read-access and expire automatically.

Scans occur fully in memory and results are rendered directly to you.

Optional self-hosting ensures you control all data flow.

##  Prevent Leaks with Pre-Commit

Run locally (no server, no GitHub access needed):

python -m app.cli --staged

Option A — Simple git hook
macOS/Linux: create .git/hooks/pre-commit:

set -e
python -m app.cli --staged
Make it executable:
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

Windows (PowerShell): create .git/hooks/pre-commit.ps1:

python -m app.cli --staged
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { exit 1 }
The commit will fail (exit code 1) if any secrets are detected.

Option B — Using the pre-commit framework
Install and configure once for the repo:

pip install pre-commit
Create .pre-commit-config.yaml in the repo root:

Copy code
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: secrets-scan
        name: secrets-scan
        entry: python -m app.cli --staged
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
Then enable it:
pre-commit install
Now every git commit will run the scanner on staged files. Use --no-verify to bypass only if you absolutely must (not recommended).



If you also added the console script, you can add this tiny note (optional):

> If installed as a package:  
> `secrets-scan --staged`  # instead of `python -m app.cli --staged`
